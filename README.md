### Part 1: Climate Analysis and Exploration
In this section, youâ€™ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to perform basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Complete the following tasks by using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

* Use the provided [starter notebook](climate_starter.ipynb) and [hawaii.sqlite](Resources) files to complete climate analysis and data exploration.

#### Precipitation Analysis

#### Station Analysis

* Plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`, as shown in the following image:

### Part 2: Design Your Climate App
List all available routes.
* `/`
* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`
* `/api/v1.0/stations`
* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

* Use the provided [app.py](app.py) to review the script created for all the above routes

### Bonus: Other Recommended Analyses

#### Temperature Analysis 
* Use the provide [temp_analysis_bonus_1_starter.ipynb](temp_analysis_bonus_1_starter.py) to review code

* ```Question``` :Use the t-test to determine whether the difference in means, if any, is statistically significant. Will you use a paired t-test or an unpaired t-test? Why?

  ```Answer```  :I will use the t-test to determine if the average temperatures between June and December are statistically significantly different. Will use the unpaired t-test   because I am comparing means from separate groups by month that are not dependent on each other.

* H0: The difference between the mean temperatures of June and December is equal to zero
  H1: The difference between the mean temperatures of June and June and December is NOT equal to zero 

* Ttest_indResult(statistic=-4.615865424404701, pvalue=0.00028626292761018595)

* p-value is less than 0.05, We can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in means is statistically significant in temperature between June and December.
